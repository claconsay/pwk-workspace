**Vulnerability**
```txt
# https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/45584
# Vulnerability:
# The code in https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/server/php/UploadHandler.php 
# doesn't require any validation to upload files to the server.  It also doesn't exclude file types.  
# This allows for remote code execution.
